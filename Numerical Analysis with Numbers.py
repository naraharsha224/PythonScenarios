# Numerical Analysis with Numbers

#Scenario: You are working with a dataset containing sales figures for a retail company. You need to calculate the total revenue for each month.
# Task: Write a Python script using numerical operations to sum up the sales figures for each month.

# Sample dataset containing sales figures (month-wise)
sales_data = {
    "January": [1000, 1500, 2000],    # Sales figures for January
    "February": [1200, 1800, 2100],   # Sales figures for February
    "March": [1100, 1600, 1900],      # Sales figures for March
}

total_revenue_per_month={}

# Iterate over each month and calculate total revenue
for month, sales_figures in sales_data.items():
    total_revenue = sum(sales_figures) # calculate the total revenue for the month
    total_revenue_per_month[month]=total_revenue # store total revenue for the month

# Print total revenue for each month
for month,revenue in total_revenue_per_month.items():
    print(f"Total revenue for {month}:{revenue}")



Output:
Total revenue for January:4500
Total revenue for February:5100
Total revenue for March:4600
